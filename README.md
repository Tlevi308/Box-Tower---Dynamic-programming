# Box-Tower-Dynamic-programming

Algorithms 1 - Running Exercise 2

Topic: Dynamic design
Stable tower
A routine must be developed with an efficiency of O(n2) which receives as input three arrays: Length, Width and Height which contain
Each n natural numbers are different from each other, constituting the dimensions of length, width and height of n boxes.
The dimensions of the box i 1≤i≤n)) are: Length [i] x Width [i] x Height [i] (Do not rotate the boxes).
The routine should present a stable tower with a maximum height and return its rate.
Note: A tower will read stable if for every box i located above box j there is Length [i] <Length [j] and also
 Width [i] <Width [j]
Make use of an initial routine that calls twice for the routine you have developed. First time with 20 boxes and once
Second with thirty boxes. Set different random numbers in the arrays in the arrays [1,200].
The program code and output obtained must be displayed.
